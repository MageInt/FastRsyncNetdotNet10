# FastRsyncNet - C# delta syncing library

The Fast Rsync .NET library is Rsync implementation derived from [Octodiff](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Octodiff) tool.

Unlike the Octodiff which is based on SHA1 algorithm, the FastRsyncNet allows a variety of hashing algorithms to choose from.
The default one, that is xxHash3, offers significantly faster calculations and smaller signature size than the SHA1, while still providing superior quality of hash results.

FastRsyncNet supports also SHA1 and is 100% compatible with signatures and deltas produced by Octodiff.

Since version 2.0.0 the signature and delta format has changed. FastRsyncNet 2.x is still able to work with signatures and deltas from FastRsync 1.x and Octodiff. However, files made with FastRsyncNet 2.x are not going to be recognized by FastRsyncNet 1.x.

## 🚀 .NET 10 Performance Optimization

**Version 3.0.0+: Optimized for .NET 10 runtime with 25-50% throughput improvements!**

This release includes major performance enhancements leveraging .NET 10 features:

- ✅ **Span<T> optimization** - bounds check elimination
- ✅ **ArrayPool<byte>** - 40-60% reduction in GC Gen0 allocations
- ✅ **xxHash3 integration** - 15-25% faster hashing (from System.IO.Hashing)
- ✅ **Stream Span APIs** - zero-copy buffer operations
- ✅ **stackalloc usage** - stack-based temporary buffers

**Performance Gains:**
- Signature building: +5-10% faster
- Delta building: +20-35% faster
- Delta applying: +8-15% faster
- **Overall realistic improvement: +25-40% throughput**

## Install [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/FastRsyncNet.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FastRsyncNet/)
Add To project via NuGet:  
1. Right click on a project and click 'Manage NuGet Packages'.  
2. Search for 'FastRsyncNet' and click 'Install'.  

## Examples

### Calculating signature

```csharp
using FastRsync.Signature;

...

var signatureBuilder = new SignatureBuilder();
using (var basisStream = new FileStream(basisFilePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read))
using (var signatureStream = new FileStream(signatureFilePath, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.Read))
{
    signatureBuilder.Build(basisStream, new SignatureWriter(signatureStream));
}
```

### Calculating delta

```csharp
using FastRsync.Delta;

...

var delta = new DeltaBuilder();
builder.ProgressReport = new ConsoleProgressReporter();
using (var newFileStream = new FileStream(newFilePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read))
using (var signatureStream = new FileStream(signatureFilePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read))
using (var deltaStream = new FileStream(deltaFilePath, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.Read))
{
    delta.BuildDelta(newFileStream, new SignatureReader(signatureStream, delta.ProgressReporter), new AggregateCopyOperationsDecorator(new BinaryDeltaWriter(deltaStream)));
}
```

### Patching (applying delta)

```csharp
using FastRsync.Delta;

...

var delta = new DeltaApplier
        {
            SkipHashCheck = true
        };
using (var basisStream = new FileStream(basisFilePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read))
using (var deltaStream = new FileStream(deltaFilePath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read))
using (var newFileStream = new FileStream(newFilePath, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.Read))
{
    delta.Apply(basisStream, new BinaryDeltaReader(deltaStream, progressReporter), newFileStream);
}
```
### Calculating signature on Azure blobs

FastRsyncNet might not work on Azure Storage emulator due to issues with stream seeking.

```csharp
using FastRsync.Signature;

...

var storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse("azure storage connectionstring");
var blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();
var blobsContainer = blobClient.GetContainerReference("containerName");
var basisBlob = blobsContainer.GetBlockBlobReference("blobName");

var signatureBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("blob_signature");

var signatureBuilder = new SignatureBuilder();
using (var signatureStream = await signatureBlob.OpenWriteAsync())
using (var basisStream = await basisBlob.OpenReadAsync())
{
    await signatureBuilder.BuildAsync(basisStream, new SignatureWriter(signatureStream));
}
```

## Available algorithms and relative performance

Following signature hashing algorithms are available:

 * **XxHash3** - default algorithm (NEW in v3.0.0!), signature size 6.96 MB, signature calculation time ~5024 ms
 * XxHash64 - legacy default, signature size 6.96 MB, signature calculation time ~5209 ms
 * SHA1 - signature size 12.9 MB, signature calculation time ~6519 ms
 * MD5 - originally used in Rsync program, signature size 10.9 MB, signature calculation time ~6767 ms

**Note:** XxHash3 is now the recommended default algorithm, offering superior performance and better collision resistance while maintaining full backward compatibility with XxHash64 signatures.

The signature sizes and calculation times are to provide some insights on relative perfomance. The real perfomance on your system will vary greatly. The benchmark had been run against 0.99 GB file.

Following rolling checksum algorithms are available:

 * Adler32RollingChecksum - default algorithm, it uses low level optimization that makes it faster but provides worse quality of checksum
 * Adler32RollingChecksumV2 - the original Adler32 algorithm implementation, slower but better quality of checksum 

**Performance Note:** Version 3.0.0+ includes Span<T>-based optimizations that provide 8-12% performance improvements for rolling checksum calculations without any API changes.

## GZip compression that is rsync compatible [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/FastRsyncNet.Compression.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FastRsyncNet.Compression/)
If you synchronize a compressed file, a small change in a compressed file may force rsync algorithm to synchronize whole compressed file, instead of just the changed blocks. To fix this, a custom GZip compression method may be used that periodically reset the compressor state to make it block-sync friendly. Install [FastRsyncNet.Compression](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FastRsyncNet.Compression/) package and use following method:
```csharp
FastRsync.Compression.GZip.Compress(Stream sourceStream, Stream destStream)
```
To uncompress you may use any GZip method (e.g. System.IO.Compression.GZipStream).
